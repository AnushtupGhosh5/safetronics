## Research Summary

### Overview of Field
Based on comprehensive review by Mills et al. (2017) analyzing **234 in-pipe robotic systems** over 30 years:

- **Wall-pressing is dominant:** 44% of all research robots use wall-pressing traction
- **Wheeled systems most common:** 43% use wheels as primary locomotion
- **Caterpillar/tracked systems:** 11% of systems, with 75% using wall-pressing
- **Snake robots emerging:** 13% of systems, showing best diameter adaptability
- **Target diameter range (75-150mm) is well-studied:** Multiple commercial and research platforms exist

### Critical Finding: Shape Adaptability Challenge
**The #1 limitation of traditional pipe robots is diameter adaptability:**
- Traditional full-bore wall-press robots: typically 20-50mm adaptability range
- Example: AGH University robot (200mm) - only 34mm range (17% adaptability)
- Example: Hanyang flat robot - only 20mm range, becomes unstable beyond this
- **Implication:** Networks with 75-150mm range would traditionally require 2-3 different robot sizes

---

## Findings

### 1. LOCOMOTION MECHANISMS FOR 75-150MM PIPES

#### A. Wall-Press Mechanisms (Most Relevant)
**Principle:** Generate traction by pressing against pipe walls using expandable mechanisms

**Advantages:**
- Works in any orientation (horizontal, vertical, angled)
- Reliable traction generation
- Well-proven technology (since 1987)
- Can handle slopes and vertical sections

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited diameter adaptability (typically <50mm range)
- Struggles with T-sections and valves (contact loss)
- Requires centralized chassis (limits transformation range)
- Multiple robot sizes needed for wide diameter ranges

**Key Designs:**
1. **2-Plane Design:** Simpler, less stable, requires precise centering
2. **3-Plane Design:** Good balance of stability and complexity (most common)
3. **4-Plane Design:** Maximum stability, more complex, heavier

**Adaptation Mechanisms:**
- **Parallelogram linkage:** Keeps contact planes parallel to pipe wall
- **Pantograph/scissor mechanism:** Popular for diameter changes
- **Lead screw actuation:** Central control of all planes simultaneously

**Specific Examples for Our Range:**
- **PipeTron Series (HiBot, Tokyo):** Specifically designed for **75mm, 100mm, and 150mm** pipes
  - Passively articulated wheels
  - Tethered for instant retrieval
  - Multiple platforms for each diameter (limited adaptability)
  - Proven in refineries and chemical plants

#### B. Caterpillar/Tracked Systems
**Principle:** Use continuous tracks for high friction contact area

**Advantages:**
- High traction force (large contact surface area)
- More stable than wheels
- Excellent for vertical climbing
- Resistant to slip

**Disadvantages:**
- Generally larger and heavier than wheeled systems
- More complex mechanically
- Higher power consumption

**Adaptability Examples:**
- **Tarbiat Modares University:** 3-plane caterpillar, 250-350mm range (100mm adaptability)
- **Ritsumeikan University:** Parallelogram crawler, 136-226mm range (90mm adaptability - impressive!)
- **Paroys-II:** Pantograph mechanism, 400-700mm range (300mm adaptability)

**Key Finding:** Caterpillar systems can achieve better adaptability than wheeled systems when using active mechanisms.

#### C. Snake/Modular Systems (Emerging Solution)
**Principle:** Articulated modules that can reconfigure for different diameters

**Advantages:**
- **Exceptional diameter adaptability** (100-300mm demonstrated)
- Can pass through valves and complex obstacles
- Non-full-bore design (can enter through smaller access points)
- Modular - can add/remove sections

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex control systems
- Higher number of actuators
- Slower than traditional designs
- More expensive

**Specific Example:**
- **Kanagawa University Snake:** 100-300mm range using modular caterpillar units
  - Add more units for larger diameters
  - Each unit only 50mm
  - **200mm adaptability range** (4x unit size!)

**Relevance to Our Project:** Snake design could cover entire 75-150mm range with single robot, but complexity may exceed budget.

#### D. Wheeled Systems
**Most Common (43% of systems)** - highly adaptable to other mechanisms

**Key Examples:**
- **MRINSPECT (Sungkyunkwan University):** 130-180mm, 50mm adaptability
- **AQAM:** 260-300mm, single-plane design with exceptional maneuverability
- **Shanghai robot:** 400-650mm, 3-plane parallelogram (250mm adaptability)

### 2. VERTICAL PIPE CLIMBING SOLUTIONS

**Critical Requirement:** Must generate sufficient normal force to overcome gravity

**Successful Approaches:**
1. **Wall-Press + High Traction:**
   - Caterpillar tracks preferred over wheels (larger contact area)
   - Active force control (not just passive springs)
   - Typical requirement: 2-3x robot weight in normal force

2. **Magnetic Adhesion (for metal pipes):**
   - **MagneBike:** Wheeled magnetic robot, 300mm max diameter
   - Simplifies T-sections (no wall contact needed)
   - **Limitation:** Only works on ferrous pipes (not PVC)
   - **Not recommended for our project:** Need to work on both metal AND PVC

3. **Screw/Helical Systems:**
   - Naturally resistant to back-driving (good for vertical)
   - Spiral motion provides continuous wall contact
   - **Heli-Pipe:** Multiple versions for different diameters (limited adaptability)

**Recommendation for 75-150mm Vertical Climbing:**
- Wall-press + caterpillar tracks
- Active diameter adaptation (lead screw controlled)
- Minimum 3-plane design for stability
- Target normal force: 3x robot weight (for 3kg robot = 9kg force distributed)

### 3. SENSOR CONFIGURATIONS FOR INSPECTION

**From MRCINSPECT (Jang et al., 2022) - 500mm diameter robot:**
- **Primary:** CMOS camera for visual inspection
- **Navigation:** Contact sensor modules for miter bend recognition
- **Orientation:** IMU (likely MPU-6050 or similar) for tilt/position
- **Distance:** ToF sensors for wall distance measurement

**From Mills et al. Review:**
- **Visual inspection:** Cameras are universal (100% of inspection robots)
- **Defect detection:** Visual odometry + deep learning emerging
- **Crack/corrosion:** Image processing (edge detection, morphology)
- **Gas leaks:** MQ-series sensors common in industrial applications
- **Environmental:** Temperature, humidity for leak detection

**Sensor Fusion Approach:**
- Multiple sensor modalities increase reliability
- Contact sensors + distance sensors for navigation
- Camera + environmental sensors for inspection
- IMU essential for orientation tracking in pipes

### 4. COMMON FAILURE MODES & MITIGATIONS

**Failure Mode 1: Loss of Wall Contact**
- **Occurs at:** T-sections, valves, diameter changes
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Multi-plane designs (3-4 planes)
  - Active force control
  - Snake/modular designs that don't rely on full-bore contact

**Failure Mode 2: Insufficient Traction on Slopes**
- **Cause:** Inadequate normal force, smooth pipe walls
- **Mitigation:**
  - Caterpillar tracks (higher friction)
  - Increased wall-press force
  - Screw-type locomotion (inherently resistant to slip)

**Failure Mode 3: Stuck in Diameter Transitions**
- **Cause:** Limited adaptability range
- **Mitigation:**
  - Active adaptation mechanisms (not passive springs)
  - Larger adaptability range (target 2x minimum diameter)
  - Modular/snake designs

**Failure Mode 4: Power Limitations**
- **Cause:** High power draw from motors, limited battery
- **Mitigation:**
  - Efficient motor selection (geared DC motors)
  - Optimized wall-press force (not excessive)
  - Power management (sleep modes when stationary)

**Failure Mode 5: Communication Loss (Tethered Systems)**
- **Cause:** Cable snagging, length limitations
- **Mitigation:**
  - Wireless communication (WiFi/BLE)
  - Onboard data logging
  - Autonomous navigation capabilities

### 5. COST-EFFECTIVE & REPLICABLE DESIGNS

**Budget-Conscious Insights:**
- **Passive adaptation is cheaper** but limits range (20-50mm typical)
- **Active adaptation requires:** Lead screw + motor + linkages (adds ₹500-800)
- **Caterpillar tracks** can be 3D printed or made from rubber belts
- **Wheeled systems** are simplest and cheapest
- **Snake/modular** systems multiply costs (each module needs actuators)

**Replicable Design Patterns:**
1. **3-Plane Wheeled Wall-Press (Recommended for Budget):**
   - 3x geared DC motors for locomotion
   - 1x servo/stepper for diameter adaptation
   - Parallelogram or pantograph linkage (3D printable)
   - Estimated cost: ₹2,000-2,500 for mechanical

2. **2-Module Caterpillar (Higher Performance):**
   - 2x caterpillar track modules
   - Active pantograph mechanism
   - Better vertical climbing
   - Estimated cost: ₹2,500-3,000 for mechanical

**Cost Breakdown from Literature (Scaled to Our Budget):**
- **Mechanical (chassis, linkages, tracks/wheels):** 40-50% of budget
- **Motors & drivers:** 25-30%
- **Sensors:** 15-20%
- **Electronics (MCU, power):** 15-20%
