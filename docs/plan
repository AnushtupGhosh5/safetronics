Here’s the **complete overview** of what you’re building 👇

## 🦾 **Project Title:**

**WorkSafeBot: Autonomous Safety & Pipe Inspection Robot for Industrial Workspaces**

---

## 🎯 **Theme:**

**Theme 3 – Safe Workspace**
Preventing industrial accidents through autonomous inspection, hazard detection, and predictive maintenance.

---

## 💡 **Core Idea:**

You’re building a **multi-purpose autonomous robot** designed to enhance **workplace safety** in industrial environments (factories, refineries, chemical plants).
It combines **environmental monitoring, real-time hazard detection**, and **internal pipe inspection** into a single modular robot.

Instead of deploying multiple robots for air quality, temperature, and pipe inspection, you’re designing **one robot that can transform or attach modules** to handle both *surface-level safety monitoring* and *internal pipeline inspection.*

## ⚙️ **System Overview & Flow:**

### 🔹 **1. Industrial Safety Monitoring Mode (Surface)**

**Purpose:** Detect environmental and operational hazards in the workspace.

**Functions:**

* Detect toxic gases, fire, and smoke leaks.
* Monitor temperature, humidity, and air quality in hazardous areas.
* Detect vibration anomalies near machines (indicating potential failure).
* Capture visual data for the digital twin dashboard (real-time status of the factory).

**Sensors Used:**

* MQ-2 / MQ-9 → Gas leak and smoke detection
* DHT11 / DHT22 → Temperature and humidity
* IR/ToF (VL53L0X) → Obstacle detection
* MPU6050 → Motion & vibration sensing
* Camera Module (Raspberry Pi Camera / CMOS) → Visual monitoring
* Optional ML module → Detect flames, smoke, or unsafe worker behavior (PPE violations)

---

### 🔹 **2. Pipe Inspection Mode (Internal)**

**Purpose:** Inspect confined or narrow pipelines without human intervention.

**Functions:**

* Navigate through narrow pipes to detect **corrosion, cracks, blockages, and leaks**.
* Collect air/gas composition data inside pipes.
* Stream real-time visuals to the control dashboard.
* Identify early warning signs for **predictive maintenance**.

**Sensors Used:**

* **Camera (Endoscope or CMOS)** – Visual inspection of interior walls.
* **VL53L0X Time-of-Flight Sensor (×2–3 units)** – Measures distance from pipe walls for centering & obstacle avoidance.
* **MQ Gas Sensor** – Detects flammable or toxic leaks.
* **DHT11** – Detects humidity/temperature anomalies indicating leaks or steam.
* **MPU6050** – Detects tilt, vibration, and helps with navigation/orientation.

**Motors:**

* **High-torque geared DC motors or servo motors** for linear motion.
* **Differential drive setup** for turns.
* **Optional: Magnetic wheel/legged design** for clinging to pipe walls (if vertical).

---

### 🔹 **3. Digital Twin Dashboard (Central Interface)**

**Purpose:** Real-time monitoring and predictive safety analytics.

**Functions:**

* Displays a **virtual twin** of the workspace with live sensor data overlays.
* Highlights risk zones using color coding (Green – Safe, Red – Hazard).
* Receives alerts when gas concentration, vibration, or heat crosses thresholds.
* Logs historical data for analysis and pattern detection.
* Integrates both **robot modes** (surface and pipe) into one visualization dashboard.

**Tech Stack:**

* Backend: **FastAPI / Flask**
* Dashboard: **React / Plotly Dash**
* Database: **SQLite / InfluxDB** (for time-series data)
* Communication: **MQTT / WebSocket**
* AI Models: On-device **TinyML (for anomaly detection)** or **Edge ML models (for PPE, smoke)**

   ↳ Enters pipe → Detects corrosion, cracks, leaks → Sends visuals + sensor logs  

        ↓  
[Dashboard Aggregates Data]  
   ↳ AI processes sensor readings → Predicts risks  
   ↳ Generates maintenance alerts  
   ↳ Creates safety reports for supervisors
```

## 🧠 **AI & Predictive Logic**

* **Anomaly Detection:** ML model trained on historical data (temperature, gas levels, vibrations) predicts potential hazards before they occur.
* **Visual Analysis:** Lightweight CNN model for detecting smoke, corrosion patterns, or worker safety violations.
* **Risk Scoring:** Combines sensor fusion results into a real-time “Risk Index” displayed on dashboard.

---

## 🔋 **Power & Mobility**

* Powered via **Li-ion battery pack** (6–12V).
* Chassis made of lightweight aluminum or acrylic.
* For confined pipes: **modular detachable design** with camera head + sensor module.
* Optional **wireless charging** or **hot-swap batteries** for long missions.
