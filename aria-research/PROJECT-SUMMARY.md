## 🔑 Key Design Decisions (To Be Researched)

### Pending Validation
These assumptions require research verification:

1. **Microcontroller:** ESP32-CAM vs Arduino Mega vs STM32
2. **Locomotion:** Wall-press + caterpillar vs pure wheeled
3. **Power:** 2S vs 3S Li-ion configuration
4. **ML Capability:** TFLite Micro feasible on ESP32?
5. **Camera:** ESP32-CAM built-in vs external OV5647
6. **Motor Drivers:** L298N vs TB6612FNG vs DRV8833

### Validated Constraints
- No Raspberry Pi (too expensive at ₹3,500+)
- Local MQTT only (no cloud)
- 3D printing available for chassis
- Budget strictly <₹4,200
