## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: ESP32-WROOM-32 Module (₹343 / ~$4.10 USD)**

After comprehensive analysis of ESP32 variants available in India, the ESP32-WROOM-32 is the optimal choice for WorkSafeBot due to:
- **Lowest cost** (₹343) maximizing budget for motors/chassis/battery
- **Abundant GPIO** (34 pins) for multi-sensor + motor control
- **Proven platform** with extensive documentation and community support
- **Adequate performance** (dual-core 240MHz) for sensor fusion + MQTT + navigation

**Alternative:** ESP32-CAM (₹627) if integrated camera is critical for Round 1, accepting GPIO limitations (9 usable pins).

**NOT Recommended:** ESP32-S3-DevKitC (₹1,424) - 4x cost premium without proportional benefit for this application.

### 2. GPIO Pin Comparison

| Microcontroller | Total GPIO | Usable GPIO | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **ESP32-WROOM-32** | **48** | **34** | **Most flexible, well-documented pinout** |
| ESP32-S3 (chip) | 48 | 45 | Chip-level spec |
| ESP32-S3 (dev board) | 48 | 26-34 | Varies by board design |
| **ESP32-CAM** | **32** | **9-10** | **Many pins used by camera/flash/PSRAM** |

**ESP32-CAM GPIO Limitations (CRITICAL):**
- Only 9-10 GPIO pins available for user applications
- Default I2C: GPIO 21 (SDA), GPIO 22 (SCL) - can be reassigned
- **Avoid GPIO 14 & 15** when using I2C (conflicts with SD/SPI/WiFi)
- GPIO 0, 1, 3 reserved for flashing and serial communication
- Camera module uses 8-10 pins internally

**WorkSafeBot GPIO Requirements:**
- I2C bus: 2 pins (SDA, SCL) - shared by 6 sensors
- Motor PWM: 4 pins (2 motors × 2 channels for direction control)
- Camera (if parallel interface): 8-10 pins
- Extras (LED, button, buzzer): 2-3 pins
- **Minimum needed:** 6 pins (I2C + motors)
- **Recommended:** 15+ pins for flexibility

**Verdict:** ESP32-CAM's 9 GPIO is barely sufficient (6 required + 3 spare). ESP32-WROOM's 34 GPIO provides comfortable margin.

**Citations:**
- Google AI Overview: "ESP32-CAM has limited accessible GPIO pins because many are used by camera module"
- Last Minute Engineers: "ESP32-CAM only has 10 GPIO pins available"
- Reddit r/esp32: "Do NOT use pins 14 & 15 while accessing I2C"

**Confidence:** HIGH - Multiple consistent sources

### 4. Power Consumption Analysis

**ESP32 Power Profiles:**
- Active WiFi: 160-260 mA (ESP32), 130-210 mA (ESP32-S3)
- Light sleep: ~0.8 mA
- Deep sleep: ~10 μA

**WorkSafeBot Power Budget (30-60 min runtime):**
- Battery: 18650 Li-ion, 2500 mAh (assumed)
- 30 min runtime: 5000 mA average draw allowed
- 60 min runtime: 2500 mA average draw allowed

**Component Power Breakdown (estimated):**
- MCU (ESP32): 200 mA (8-10% of budget)
- Sensors (7 total): ~250 mA (10-12% of budget)
- Motors (2× DC): 1000-2000 mA (40-80% of budget)
- Camera: 100-150 mA (4-6% of budget)

**Verdict:** MCU power consumption is NOT a deciding factor. Motors dominate power budget. ESP32-S3's 20-30% power efficiency improvement saves only ~40-60 mA, which is negligible compared to motor draw.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM - Based on typical component specifications, actual testing needed

---

### 5. Processing Power Assessment

**TFLite Micro Feasibility on ESP32:**
- ESP32 dual-core 240MHz is sufficient for lightweight ML models
- PSRAM (4-8MB) helpful but not required for simple models
- Example: MobileNet v1 quantized runs at ~5-10 FPS on ESP32
- Our use case: Anomaly detection, crack detection (simpler than object detection)

**MQTT Performance:**
- ESP32 handles MQTT easily (lightweight protocol)
- Local MQTT broker (no cloud) reduces latency and bandwidth
- Sensor data: ~100 bytes/message, 10 Hz = 1 KB/s (trivial)

**Sensor Fusion:**
- 6 sensors at 10-50 Hz = 60-300 readings/sec
- Simple averaging/filtering: <1% CPU usage
- Kalman filter: ~5-10% CPU usage

**Verdict:** ESP32-WROOM-32 has adequate processing power for all planned tasks. ESP32-S3's LX7 cores offer ~20% performance improvement, but this is not needed for our application.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Based on community benchmarks and similar projects

### 6. Camera Integration Options

**Option A: ESP32-CAM (Integrated)**
- ✅ Pros: Compact, all-in-one, proven camera interface
- ❌ Cons: Only 9 GPIO, limits expansion, ₹627 cost
- Use case: If camera is critical for Round 1

**Option B: ESP32-WROOM + Serial Camera Module**
- ✅ Pros: 34 GPIO preserved, flexible, modular
- ❌ Cons: Requires UART (2 GPIO), lower resolution options
- Example: VC0706 serial camera (~₹400-600)

**Option C: ESP32-WROOM + Parallel Camera Module**
- ✅ Pros: High resolution (OV2640), fast frame rate
- ❌ Cons: Uses 8-10 GPIO, complex wiring
- Example: OV2640 module (~₹300-400)

**Option D: No Camera for MVP (Round 1)**
- ✅ Pros: Lowest cost, simplest design, focus on locomotion
- ✅ Pros: Add camera for Round 2 if we advance
- ❌ Cons: May not meet competition requirements

**Recommendation:** Start with Option D (no camera) for MVP, add Option C (parallel camera) for Round 2 if budget allows.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM - Depends on competition requirements interpretation

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation
**Use ESP32-WROOM-32 Module (₹343) as the main microcontroller for WorkSafeBot.**

**Justification:**
1. **Cost-effective:** Saves ₹284 vs ESP32-CAM, ₹1,081 vs ESP32-S3
2. **GPIO-rich:** 34 pins provide flexibility for sensors, motors, and future expansion
3. **Proven platform:** Extensive documentation, large community, mature ecosystem
4. **Adequate performance:** Dual-core 240MHz sufficient for all planned tasks
5. **Modular approach:** Can add camera module later without redesign

### Alternative Recommendation
**Use ESP32-CAM (₹627) IF:**

- Compact size is critical (75mm pipe constraint)
- Willing to accept GPIO limitations (9 pins)

**Mitigation for GPIO limits:**
- Use I2C for all sensors (shares 2 pins)
- Use I2C motor driver (PCA9685) instead of direct PWM
- Careful pin assignment to avoid conflicts

### NOT Recommended
**ESP32-S3-DevKitC (₹1,424)** - Cost premium (4x) not justified by benefits:
- 20% performance improvement not needed
- 20-30% power efficiency saves only ~50mA (negligible)
- Bluetooth 5.0 not required (local MQTT only)
- Better spent on quality motors, battery, or chassis
