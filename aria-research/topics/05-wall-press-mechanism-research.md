## Executive Summary

Wall-press mechanisms are critical for pipe inspection robots to maintain traction and stability, especially in vertical and angled pipes. Research reveals three primary approaches: **active servo-actuated systems**, **passive spring-loaded systems**, and **hybrid parallelogram linkage mechanisms**. For the WorkSafeBot project with a strict ₹4,200 budget and 75-150mm pipe diameter range, a **spring-loaded parallelogram linkage mechanism** is recommended as the optimal solution, offering simplicity, reliability, and cost-effectiveness (estimated ₹300-500).

### Key Recommendations

1. **Primary Design:** Spring-loaded parallelogram linkage with 3-wheel modules (120° spacing)
2. **Actuation:** Passive spring mechanism (no motors required for wall-press)
3. **Materials:** 3D printed PLA/PETG for linkages, compression springs for force
4. **Force Target:** 2-5N per contact point for 75-150mm pipes
5. **Estimated Cost:** ₹300-500 (springs, bearings, hardware)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Pipe inspection robots must maintain consistent contact with pipe walls to:
- Generate sufficient traction for movement (especially vertical climbing)
- Ensure stability during navigation through elbows and bends
- Adapt to varying pipe diameters (75-150mm range for WorkSafeBot)
- Prevent slippage and maintain sensor positioning

### 1.2 Research Objectives

1. Identify wall-press mechanism types used in successful pipe robots
2. Evaluate parallelogram/pantograph linkage designs
3. Determine force requirements for 75-150mm pipes
4. Assess budget-friendly actuator options
5. Validate 3D printing feasibility for mechanism components
6. Provide implementation guidance with cost analysis

## 2. Wall-Press Mechanism Types

### 2.1 Active Wall-Press Systems

**Description:** Motor or servo-actuated mechanisms that actively control contact force.

**Advantages:**
- Precise force control
- Adaptable to varying pipe conditions
- Can adjust grip during operation

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher cost (₹500-1,500 per actuator)
- Increased power consumption
- Added complexity and weight
- Requires control system integration

**Examples:**
- MRINSPECT VI: Multi-axial differential gear mechanism with single motor drive
- Servo-actuated scissor linkages

**Budget Assessment:** ❌ Too expensive for ₹4,200 total budget

### 2.2 Passive Spring-Loaded Systems

**Description:** Compression or extension springs provide constant outward force against pipe walls.

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Very low cost (₹50-150 per spring)
- ✅ No power consumption
- ✅ Simple, reliable design
- ✅ Self-adapting to diameter variations
- ✅ Lightweight

**Disadvantages:**
- Fixed force (cannot adjust dynamically)
- Spring fatigue over time
- May require careful spring selection for force range

**Examples:**
- Spring-loaded wheel modules (common in budget designs)
- Radial spring mechanisms

**Budget Assessment:** ✅ Excellent for budget constraints

### 2.3 Parallelogram Linkage Mechanisms

**Description:** Four-bar linkage systems that maintain parallel orientation while expanding/contracting radially.

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Maintains wheel alignment with pipe center
- ✅ Smooth diameter adaptation
- ✅ Can be passive (spring) or active (servo)
- ✅ Proven in research (multiple IEEE papers)

**Disadvantages:**
- Slightly more complex than simple springs
- Requires precise linkage geometry
- More parts to manufacture

**Examples:**
- Underactuated parallelogram shape-shifting robots (Kakogawa et al., 2023)
- Linkage-type mechanical clutch systems

**Budget Assessment:** ✅ Good balance of performance and cost

## 4. Force Requirements Analysis

### 4.1 Traction Force Calculation

For vertical climbing, minimum normal force required:

```
F_normal = (m * g) / (μ * n)
```

Where:
- m = robot mass (~2kg estimated)
- g = 9.81 m/s²
- μ = coefficient of friction (rubber on PVC ≈ 0.6-0.8)
- n = number of contact points (6 wheels, 3 per side)

**Calculation:**
```
F_normal = (2 * 9.81) / (0.7 * 6) = 4.67N per wheel
```

**Safety Factor:** 1.5x → **7N per wheel recommended**

### 4.2 Spring Selection

For 75-150mm diameter range:

**Compression Spring Specifications:**
- Free length: 40-50mm
- Compressed length: 20-30mm
- Spring constant: 0.5-1.0 N/mm
- Force at working length: 5-10N
- Material: Stainless steel (corrosion resistance)

**Estimated Cost:** ₹50-100 per spring × 6 springs = ₹300-600

### 4.3 Diameter Adaptation

**Mechanism Travel:**
- Minimum diameter: 75mm → radius 37.5mm
- Maximum diameter: 150mm → radius 75mm
- Required radial travel: 37.5mm per side

**Linkage Design:**
- Parallelogram arm length: 50-60mm
- Pivot spacing: 30-40mm
- Ensures smooth expansion across full range
