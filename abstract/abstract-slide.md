# Abstract
## WorkSafeBot: Affordable Autonomous Safety Monitoring

---

## Project Overview

WorkSafeBot is an autonomous dual-mode robot designed to detect workplace hazards in industrial environments. Built for under $50, it combines surface navigation and pipe inspection capabilities in a single platform. Seven integrated sensors monitor toxic gases, temperature extremes, air quality, and structural vibrations in real-time. The system eliminates human exposure to hazardous environments while making enterprise-grade safety accessible to small and medium enterprises.

## Core Objectives

### Enhance Worker Safety
Eliminate human exposure to toxic gases, extreme temperatures, and confined spaces through autonomous monitoring. Provide real-time hazard detection with instant alerts preventing accidents before they occur. Enable 24/7 surveillance without worker fatigue or risk.

### Democratize Safety Technology
Deliver comprehensive hazard monitoring under $50 making it accessible to SMEs. Use open-source design and locally sourced components enabling manufacturing in developing economies. Require minimal training for operation removing technical barriers.

### Comprehensive Hazard Detection
Detect seven hazard types including methane, carbon monoxide, LPG, smoke, temperature, humidity, and vibrations. Operate in both open industrial spaces and confined areas like pipes and tanks. Provide continuous monitoring with historical data analysis for predictive maintenance.
