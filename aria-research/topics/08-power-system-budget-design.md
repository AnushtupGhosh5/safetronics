- Avoid operation in hot water pipes (>60°C)

### Risk 5: Component Availability

**Likelihood:** LOW  
**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Mitigation:**
- All components verified in stock (Robu.in)
- Order immediately to secure availability
- Identify alternative suppliers (Amazon.in, local electronics shops)

### Risk 6: Budget Overrun

**Likelihood:** LOW  
**Impact:** LOW  
**Mitigation:**
- Power system cost is 37% under initial estimate (₹504 vs ₹800)
- ₹296 savings available for basic components if needed
- Buffer of ₹400 minimum
