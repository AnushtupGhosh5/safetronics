## Design Considerations

### 1. Track Material Selection

**For 3D Printing:**
- **PLA:** Easy to print, rigid, but brittle (NOT RECOMMENDED for tracks)
- **ABS:** Stronger, more flexible, better for tracks
- **TPU (Flexible Filament):** Best for tracks, excellent grip, durable
- **PETG:** Good compromise - strong and somewhat flexible

**Recommendation:** TPU for track segments, ABS for structural parts

### 2. Track Tension System

**Critical for Performance:**
- Too loose: Tracks slip off wheels
- Too tight: Excessive friction, motor strain, premature wear

**Solutions:**
- Adjustable idler wheel position (spring-loaded)
- Tensioning screws for fine adjustment
- Regular maintenance checks

### 3. Motor Torque Requirements

**Caterpillar tracks require MORE torque than wheels:**
- Friction from multiple contact points
- Weight of track system
- Resistance from wall-press mechanism

**N20 Motor Specs (from Topic 02):**
- Torque: 0.8-2.5 kg·cm (depending on gear ratio)
- Speed: 60-200 RPM

**Recommendation:** Use 1:100 or 1:150 gear ratio N20 motors for maximum torque

### 4. Track Speed and Control

**Differential Steering:**
- Left tracks: Motor 1 + Motor 2
- Right tracks: Motor 3 + Motor 4
- Forward: All motors same speed, same direction
- Turn: Reduce speed on one side or reverse
- Spin: Opposite directions at same speed

**Speed Control:**
- PWM control via L298N motor driver (from Topic 09)
- Speed range: 0-100% duty cycle
- Typical inspection speed: 5-15 cm/s
