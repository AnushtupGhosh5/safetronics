## Summary

Comprehensive review of 234 in-pipe robotic systems over 30 years. Analyzes wall-pressing mechanisms and shape adaptability challenges. Concludes traditional full-bore wall-pressing robots limited by adaptability range.

## Key Findings

- Wall-pressing: 44% of systems
- Wheeled locomotion: 43% of systems  
- Caterpillar + wall-press: 75% of tracked robots
- PipeTron series: 75mm, 100mm, 150mm pipes
- Snake robots: 100-300mm adaptability range
