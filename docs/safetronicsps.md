# The Safetronics Challenge

### Introduction

Imagine a world where homes, schools, and workplaces are safer, smarter, and
more resilient: powered by young innovators like you.
In India, accidental deaths at home claim **45,000+ lives annually (NCRB,
2022)** , workplace accidents cause **48,000+ injuries** and **4,000+ deaths**
(Ministry of Labour & Employment, 2023), and schools see **33M+ children** affected
by risks each year (UNICEF & NCERT, 2023).
**The Safetionics Challenge** invites high school and university students to tackle
these issues by designing robotics-based safety solutions. Using accessible tools
and STEM skills, you’ll create prototypes that blend classroom learning with
real-world impact. Harnessing **Physical AI** ; robots that intelligently sense and
interact with their environment, you can shape a safer future while showcasing your
creativity at **Techfest, IIT Bombay** , one of Asia’s largest science and technology
festivals.
The challenge spans three safety themes; choose one and build a solution that
could redefine community safety worldwide.

### General Elements Across Themes:

To ensure accessibility, innovation, and alignment with STEM education, solutions
are expected to incorporate the following elements, with higher evaluation points
awarded for effective integration:
● **Hardware** : Affordable, school-accessible tools, such as microcontrollers
(e.g., Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi) and sensors (e.g., motion, temperature,
gas, proximity each).
● **Mathematical Modeling** : Calculations (e.g., risk probability, sensor
thresholds, data trends) using tools like graphing calculators (e.g., TI-84) or
free software (e.g., Desmos).
● **Physical AI** : Autonomous behavior, such as navigating to a hazard,
prioritizing risks, or adapting responses based on real-time sensor data.
● **Scalability and Usability** : Cost-effective, user-friendly solutions adaptable
for real-world deployment in the chosen environment.


```
● Safety : Safe substitutes (e.g., ethanol vapor for gas, tilt sensors for falls) for
demos, with supervised setups to comply with Techfest’s safety protocols
(e.g., no open flames, highly acidic chemicals).
● Innovation : Novel sensor combinations, creative response mechanisms, or
advanced mathematical models to stand out and inspire change.
```
### Theme 1: HomeGuard – Securing the Heart of Every Home

Overview: Homes are where we feel safest, yet they harbor risks like accidents,
environmental hazards, and security threats. This theme challenges you to design
robotics-based solutions that protect families, making homes smarter and more
secure. Your innovation could prevent tragedies and bring peace of mind to
households everywhere.

### or

### Theme 2: CampusShield – Protecting the Future of Learning

Schools and universities are hubs of knowledge, yet risks like lab accidents,
unauthorized access, environmental hazards, and road safety threats on or near
campus grounds endanger students and staff. This theme challenges you to create
robotics-based solutions that safeguard educational environments, empowering
communities with smarter, safer campuses. Your innovation could prevent chemical
spills, secure restricted areas, improve air quality, or ensure safe navigation across
campus roads and pathways, fostering secure learning spaces.

### or

### Theme 3: WorkSafe – Building Safer Workplaces

Overview: Workplaces, from factories to farms, expose workers to risks like
machinery accidents, environmental hazards, and health threats. This theme
challenges you to develop robotics-based solutions that protect workers, creating
safer, more resilient workplaces through cutting-edge technology.

### Problem Statement:

Design a robotics-based solution that enhances safety in your chosen theme by
detecting or mitigating a specific safety issue. Using accessible tools (e.g., Arduino


Uno, Raspberry Pi, sensors like motion or gas), build a prototype that autonomously
identifies a safety concern and triggers an effective response. Integrate
mathematical modeling (e.g., risk probability, sensor thresholds using graphing
calculators like TI-84 or software like Desmos) and Physical AI principles (e.g.,
autonomous navigation or adaptive responses) to ensure your solution is
innovative, practical, and impactful.
**The following examples are provided for inspiration only; innovation is
welcomed, and teams are encouraged to develop unique ideas beyond
these, such as novel sensor integrations, adaptive automation, or
predictive analytics.**
● For HomeGuard:

1. A rover detecting gas leaks and activating an alarm or ventilation
2. A wearable sensor-linked robot alerting caregivers to falls for elderly
    residents
3. A home-assistant robot monitoring stove burners left on and
    automatically shutting off the gas supply to prevent kitchen fires.
● For CampusShield:
1. A drone detecting chemical vapors in a lab and triggering an alert or
containment
2. A rover monitoring restricted areas for unauthorized access and
notifying security
3. A robot tracking air quality (e.g., CO2 levels) in classrooms to prevent
health risks.
● For WorkSafe:
1. A rover detecting gas leaks in a factory and activating ventilation or
alerting workers
2. A robot monitoring unsafe machinery operations and signaling a
shutdown
3. A drone tracking temperature in agricultural settings to prevent heat
stress.
