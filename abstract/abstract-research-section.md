## **SLIDE 1: Existing Methods & Their Limitations**

### Current Industrial Safety Approaches

#### 1. **Static Sensor Networks**
- **Description:** Fixed gas detectors, temperature sensors, and cameras installed at predetermined locations
- **Limitations:**
  - Limited coverage (blind spots between sensors)
  - High installation cost ($5,000-$50,000 per facility)
  - Cannot inspect confined spaces or internal pipelines
  - Reactive alerts only (no predictive capability)

#### 2. **Manual Inspection Teams**
- **Description:** Workers with handheld gas detectors, thermal cameras, and visual inspection tools
- **Limitations:**
  - Exposes workers to hazardous environments
  - Time-consuming (4-8 hours per facility inspection)
  - Human error in data recording
  - Cannot access narrow pipes or toxic zones
  - **48,000+ workplace injuries annually in India** (Ministry of Labour, 2023)

#### 3. **Specialized Inspection Robots**
- **Description:** Separate robots for different tasks (e.g., pipe crawlers, gas detection rovers)
- **Examples:** 
  - GE's Drones for visual inspection ($15,000+)
  - Pipeline inspection gauges (PIGs) for oil/gas ($10,000+)
- **Limitations:**
  - Multiple systems required (high total cost)
  - No unified data platform
  - Requires trained operators for each system
  - Limited AI/predictive analytics

#### 4. **SCADA & IoT Monitoring Systems**
- **Description:** Centralized control systems with wired sensor networks
- **Limitations:**
  - Expensive infrastructure ($100,000+ for large facilities)
  - Static monitoring only
  - No physical inspection capability
  - Reactive rather than predictive

### **Key Gap Identified:**
> No single, affordable, autonomous system exists that combines **environmental monitoring**, **confined space inspection**, and **predictive AI analytics** in one platform.

## **SLIDE 3: Alternate Approaches & Novelty**

### **Comparison with Alternative Solutions**

| Approach | Strengths | Weaknesses | WorkSafeBot Advantage |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Drone-based Inspection** | Fast aerial coverage | Cannot enter pipes or confined spaces; requires open areas | Dual-mode design accesses both open and confined spaces |
| **IoT Sensor Mesh** | Comprehensive coverage | Static (no mobility); expensive deployment ($20K+) | Mobile inspection at <$50 cost; dynamic coverage |
| **Wearable Safety Tech** | Real-time worker monitoring | Reactive only; requires human presence in danger zones | Autonomous operation eliminates human risk |
| **Traditional CCTV** | Visual monitoring | No gas/temperature sensing; manual analysis required | Multi-sensor fusion + AI-powered analytics |
| **Commercial Pipe Crawlers** | Specialized inspection | Single-purpose; expensive ($10K+); no environmental monitoring | Integrated solution for multiple safety tasks |
